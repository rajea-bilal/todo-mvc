# Habitly
We can't have enough todo apps in the world. This is my rendition of it :) Habity allows users to input their daily tasks in a visually pleasing interface, keeping a track of their activities.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

- Add authentication to the app so users can create their own personalised accounts and be able to track their tasks individually.
- Build a search function that will bring tasks from a particular date in the past.
- Feature an inspirational quote that changes every day.

## Lessons Learned:

- I learnt Tailwind for this project so I would consider that the biggest takeaway.
- Finally, understand how a simple CRUD app works behind the scenes and how bigger applications are just bigger lego blocks put together.
- Gave me the confidence to build again :)
